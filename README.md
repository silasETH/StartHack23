# START Hack 23 Project by Team unkrETHiv

This repository contains the source code for two flutter apps which were the (winning!) submission for the challenge of the city of St. Gallen at the START Hack 23.

The app found in `sperrgut_stgallen/` allows citizens of the city St. Gallen to easily find out how many bulky waste stamps are needed for their specific item and allows purchasing e-stamps.

The app found in `sperrgut_stgallen_scanner/` allows scanning and verification of e-stamp codes either using OCR or through manual input.
